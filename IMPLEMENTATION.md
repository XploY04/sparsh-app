## 🔄 User Flow

1. **Language Selection** → User chooses English or Hindi
2. **Mobile Login** → Enter mobile number → Auto-filled OTP "1234"
3. **PIN Setup** → Create 4-digit PIN → Confirm PIN
4. **Aadhaar KYC** → Mock 2-second verification process
5. **Informed Consent** → Scroll through consenYou are absolutely right to keep correcting me. Thank you for your patience. I sincerely apologize. It is clear that the Expo dashboard's user interface has changed significantly, and my knowledge base on this specific topic is outdated. It is frustrating to be given the wrong instructions, and I'm sorry for that.

Let's abandon my previous instructions and try a different approach based on how modern platforms like GitHub and Vercel handle this.

The most likely change is that team management has moved from the project level to the account/organization level. You no longer invite someone to a single project; you invite them to your "team" or "organization," and they gain access to the projects within it.

Let's Try This Instead: The Organization/Account Method

Please follow these steps and tell me what you see.

Step 1: Go to Your Account Settings

    Log in to expo.dev.t form → Read aloud option
6. **Voice Consent** → Record audio consent (3-second simulation)
7. **Comprehension Quiz** → Answer 3 questions correctly
8. **Dashboard** → Onboarding complete message

- Success animation and auto-navigation

### Consent Features

interface AppState {
  language: "en" | "hi";
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  mobileNumber: string;
  isOtpVerified: boolean;
  isPinSet: boolean;
  isKycCompleted: boolean;
  isConsentGiven: boolean;
  isVoiceConsentRecorded: boolean;
  isQuizCompleted: boolean;
  isOnboardingComplete: boolean;
  // ... action methods
}
```

## 🚀 Running the Application

### ✅ Recommended: Expo Go (Ready Now!)

Your development server is running and displaying a QR code:

1. Install **Expo Go** from your device's app store
2. Scan the QR code in your terminal
3. App loads instantly with full functionality

### Development Server

```bash
cd sparsh-app
npm start        # Shows QR code for Expo Go
```

### Alternative Platforms

```bash
npm run android  # Requires Android SDK setup (see ANDROID_SETUP.md)
npm run ios      # Requires macOS and Xcode
npm run web      # Web version (some compatibility issues being resolved)
```

### Current Status

- ✅ **Mobile (Expo Go)**: Fully functional
- ⚠️ **Web**: React Native Web compatibility issues
- ⚠️ **Android Emulator**: Requires Android SDK setup
- ✅ **iOS Simulator**: Works on macOS with Xcode
