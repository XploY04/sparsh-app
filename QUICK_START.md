# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Sparsh App

## ✅ **Recommended Method: Expo Go (Works Immediately)**

### Step 1: Install Expo Go

- **Android**: Download "Expo Go" from Google Play Store
- **iOS**: Download "Expo Go" from App Store

### Step 2: Run the App

1. Your development server is already running and showing a QR code
2. Open **Expo Go** on your mobile device
3. **Scan the QR code** displayed in your terminal
4. The app will load instantly on your device!

### Step 3: Test the Complete Flow

Once loaded, you'll see the complete onboarding flow:

1. **Language Selection** - Choose English or Hindi
2. **Login** - Enter any 10-digit mobile number (OTP auto-fills "1234")
3. **PIN Setup** - Create and confirm a 4-digit PIN
4. **Aadhaar KYC** - Mock verification (takes 2 seconds)
5. **Informed Consent** - Scroll through consent form
6. **Voice Consent** - Mock recording (3 seconds)
7. **Quiz** - Answer 3 questions correctly
8. **Dashboard** - Completion screen

## 🎯 **Why Expo Go is Better for Development**

- ✅ **No setup required** - Works immediately
- ✅ **Real device testing** - Better than simulators
- ✅ **Hot reload** - Changes reflect instantly
- ✅ **Works on any device** - Android or iOS
- ✅ **No build process** - Direct JavaScript execution

## 🔧 **Alternative: Development Build (If Needed Later)**

For advanced features or custom native code:

```bash
npx expo run:android  # Requires Android Studio setup
npx expo run:ios      # Requires Xcode (macOS only)
```

## 🌐 **Web Version (In Progress)**

The web version has some React Native Web compatibility issues that are common in complex apps. For now, focus on mobile testing with Expo Go, which provides the most accurate representation of the final app experience.
