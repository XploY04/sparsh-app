## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management

```typescript
// Enhanced AppState with gamification
interface AppState {
  // Existing state...

  // Gamification additions
  totalPoints: number;
  userBadges: Badge[];
  checkinStreak: number;
  doseStreak: number;
  totalCheckins: number;
  totalDoses: number;
  earlyMorningCheckins: number;
  lastCheckinDate: string | null;
  lastDoseDate: string | null;
}
```

### Badge System Architecture

```typescript
// Badge interface
interface Badge {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  isUnlocked: boolean;
  icon: string;
}

// Automatic badge checking
const checkBadgeCriteria = (userStats, currentBadges) => {
  // Smart logic to unlock badges based on user progress
};
```

### Emergency Access Pattern

```typescript
// Persistent FAB component
<EmergencyFAB /> // Available on all main screens

// Navigation flow
MainTabs -> Emergency -> ReportEvent
```

## User Experience Enhancements

### Visual Design

- **Material Design**: Consistent with React Native Paper
- **Color Coding**:
  - Green for earned badges
  - Grey for locked badges
